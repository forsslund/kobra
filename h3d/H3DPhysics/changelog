Changes for version 1.4.1:
New fields:
- PhysX3JointOptions::enabledCollision

Deprecated features:
- PhysX3JointOptions::constraintFlag is now PhysX3JointOptions::projectionFlag.

Compatibility issues:
- Inheriting from PhysX3JointOptions and adding new options will require
  updating the values for the static bitmask variables.

Changes for version 1.4.0:
- Renamed many CMake cache variables and added functions to make it easier
  to setup H3D projects in similar fashions.
- Added CMake functionality for handling external checkouts that contain
  subdirectories built for different visual studio versions.
- Fixed many compile warnings.
- Added PID controller nodes for better coupling to haptics and also added
  some node to control collidables.
- Added more options to control the PhysX3 implementation.
- It is now possible to trigger rendering of collidables. Supposed to be
  used for debugging purposes.
- PhysX3 nodes have been much improved.
- Added support for precompiled headers.
- Added support for unity build.
- Bullet nodes have been much improved, new collision models, various
  bug fixes and more.
- Improved TriangleSetMapping
- Memory optimization with collidable shape.
- Some memory leak fixes for the bullet implementation.
- PhysX3CollidableOptions::convex field now has the same default value
  (true) as when there is no PhysX3CollidableOptions for a CollidableShape.
- PhysX3CollidableOptions can now be used to set contact reporting mode per
  collidable.

New fields:
- BulletRigidBodyOptions::softBodyCollisionOptions
- BulletSoftBodyOptions::collidesWith
- BulletSoftBodyOptions::collisionGroup
- BulletSoftBodyOptions::poseMatchingCoefficient
- BulletSoftBodyOptions::poseMatchingFrame
- BulletSoftBodyOptions::poseMatchingVolume

- CollisionCollection::collidableSelectionGroups
- PhysX3CollidableOptions::contactOffet 
- PhysX3CollidableOptions::resetOffset
- PhysX3CollidableOptions::setFlagsForAll
- PhysX3CollidableOptions::suppressDisabledContacts
- PhysX3CollidableOptions::contactShaderPairFlags
- PhysX3RigidBodyOptions::createAsStatic
- MassSpringPhysicsMaterial::stiffnessAngular
- MassSpringPhysicsMaterial::stiffnessVolume
- RigidBodyCollection::renderCollidables
- RigidBodyCollection::renderOnlyEnabledCollidables
- RigidBodyCollection::useStaticTimeStep
- RigidBodyCollection::syncGraphicsFrames
- RigidBodyCollection::syncPhysicsFrames
- SingleAxisHingeJoint::bias
- SingleAxisHingeJoint::softness

New nodes:
- ArticulatedRigidBody
- BodyPID
- CollidableSelectionGroup
- DistanceJoint
- JointPID
- PhysX3Joint6DOFLimitOptions
- PhysX3JointOptions
- PhysX3SliderJointOptions
- PIDCollection
- PIDController

Deprecated features:
- Cloth::SFX3DComposedGometryNode is now Cloth::SFX3DComposedGeometryNode.

Compatibility issues:
- Config.h and Config.cpp is now H3DPhysics.h and H3DPhysics.cpp.
- TriangleSetMapping has completely changed. Both on x3d field level and internally.
- Removal of using std in some headers means adding std:: in headers that
  previously relied on H3DAPI includes using std.
- BulletSoftBodyOptions::collisionOptions fields default value is now [SDF_RIGIDSOFT]
  instead of [ SDF_RIGIDSOFT, CLUSTER_SOFTSOFT ]. This will be an issue only for
  applications that explicitly sets that particular field to the old default value
  because CLUSTER_SOFTSOFT was previously not used internally in Bullet where as
  it is now used.
- CompositeGeometryNode is now removed.


Changes for version 1.3.0:
- Generated header is moved to CMake build directory and can only be found
 in H3DPhysics/include after INSTALL project has been built.
- Speed optimizations that could affect some compilers.
- Updates to CMake build system to build properly when TortoiseSVN is installed
 but the current H3D build is not a TortoiseSVN checkout.
- Updates to build on MinGW.
- Memory leak fixes.
- Doxygen documentation now links to python documentation as well.
- Fixes to handle sliderJoint better for most physics engines.
- Fixes to CollisionSpace and ODE.
- Changed signature of some callback functions that are never used as callbacks.
 They now have return type void.
- IndexedHexaSet, IndexedTetraSet, IndexedPointSet and IndexedElementSet are now
 more properly implemented and behaves like for example IndexedTriangleSet when
 it comes to colors, normals and texture coordinates.
- The SoftBody node no longer assumes that its geometry is of type IndexedTetraSet
 but accepts all nodes with coord and index field.

New fields:
IndexedTetraSet::renderMode
SliderJoint::sliderForce
- H3DSoftBodyLoader::filename is now H3DSoftBodyLoader::url and is an MField.
  filename can be used a while longer at X3D level. On C++ level it can not.
CollidableShape::clipPlanes
CollisionCollection::collidableExceptionGroups

New nodes:
  CollidableExceptionGroup

Changes for version 1.2.0:
- H3DPhysics additions to H3DAPIs python interface to get utility functions
 in python when using H3DPhysics.
- The package is now called H3DPhysics instead of RigidBodyPhysics.
It contains the X3D RigidBodyPhysics component as well as a well thought
through suggestion for SoftBody capabilities. Of course H3DPhysics offers
haptics capabilities for soft bodies as well.
- New physics engine implemented. PhysX3, still in alpha state.
- New physics engine implemented. SOFA, still in alpha state.
- Fixes to make sure that gravity does not affect scene before all object
are included at startup.
- Support for SoftBodies using Bullet and PhysX. This support is still in beta.
Bullet implementation is fairly stable.
- Improved bullet support. Joint types are now supported with Bullet.

Changes for version 1.0.1:

- Fixed a bug with "fixed" option and ODE.
- RigidBodyPhysics now compiles on 64 bit systems and
  Ubuntu 9.10 and gcc 3.1.1.
- CMake updates.
