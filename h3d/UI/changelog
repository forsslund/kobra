Changes for version 2.4.0:
- Properly implemented enabled field for some widgets for which it was missed.
- Renamed many CMake cache variables and added functions to make it easier
  to setup H3D projects in similar fashions.
- Added CMake functionality for handling external checkouts that contain
  subdirectories built for different visual studio versions.
- Fixed many compile warnings.
- Added support for precompiled headers.
- Added support for unity build.
- Added a way to attach custom nodes to a widget to further customize the way
  it looks.
- Changes to the way that radio buttons with group = -1 are treated: they are
  now assigned a group automatically based on their closest parent Frame.
- Performance improvement fixes.

Compatibility issues:
- Removal of using std in some headers means adding std:: in headers that
  previously relied on H3DAPI includes using std.
- The change to enabled fields could cause issues with any node inheriting from
  the affectd widget nodes (PopupMenu for example).

- Generated header is moved to CMake build directory and can only be found
 in UI/include after INSTALL project has been built.
- Speed optimizations that could affect some compilers.
- Updates to CMake build system to build properly when TortoiseSVN is installed
 but the current H3D build is not a TortoiseSVN checkout.

 FindFreetype module if it exists.
