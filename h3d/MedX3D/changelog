Changes for version 1.5.0:
- Renamed many CMake cache variables and added functions to make it easier
  to setup H3D projects in similar fashions.
- Added CMake functionality for handling external checkouts that contain
  subdirectories built for different visual studio versions.
- Fixed many compile warnings.
- Added support for precompiled headers.
- Added support for unity build.
- Smaller bug fixes.
- Improved MarchingCubes to give it the capability of using a bit more
  complicated shaders.

New fields:
- MarchingCubes::alwaysGenerateOriginalFVA
- MarchingCubes::attrib
- MarchingCubes::normalRenderMode
- MarchingCubes::texCoord
- MarchingCubes::voxelsAllowedToBeReinitialized
- MarchingCubes::writeMarchingCubesAsITS

Compatibility issues:
- Removal of using std in some headers means adding std:: in headers that
  previously relied on H3DAPI includes using std.
- The field ShadedVolumeStyle::lightRayStepSize will now be capped to the
  range [0.0001, inf) in order to avoid openGL crashes when shadows is turned on.
- The fields rayStep, useSlicing, stopRaysAtGeometries, useEmptySpaceSkipping
  showNonEmptySpace and useStochasticJittering are now only accessible 
  from C++. To modify those values in X3D a raycaster must be specified
  for the volume node.


Changes for version 1.4.0:
- Generated header is moved to CMake build directory and can only be found
 in MedX3D/include after INSTALL project has been built.
- Speed optimizations that could affect some compilers.
- Updates to CMake build system to build properly when TortoiseSVN is installed
 but the current H3D build is not a TortoiseSVN checkout.
- Memory leak fixes which added some functions.
- Fixed MultiVolumeRaycaster since it had quite a few bugs in it.

Removed fields:
- Removed multiVolumeRayCaster::depthTexture field due to it being a
 forgotten debug output which no longer affected anything.

Changes for version 1.3.0:
- Fixes to raycaster for AMD cards.
- CMake updates to configure properly for several compilers.
- Made sure every node has an example file.
- Changed color fields of several node to RGBA because of specification update.
- Restructuring to set volume renderer through renderer field in X3DVolumeNode.
- Added support for the enabled field in BlendedVolumeStyle
- Added support for orthographic projection to ray caster code
- Fixed a bug that would make the volume rendering disappear if one moved 
into the volume.
- Added support for float textures in MarchingCubes node.

New nodes
- RayCaster
- MultiVolumeRayCaster
- SliceRenderer

Removed nodes:
- IsoSurfaceVolumeStyle
	
Changes for version 1.2.0:
- ISOSurfaceVolumeData is now IsoSurfaceVolumeData. Old name kept for backwards
compatibility.
- ComposableVolumeStyle is now composable.
- Fixes for slice based rendering.
- ShadedVolumeStyle now have shadows.
- Fixes to MedX3DDemo concerning ShadedVolumeStyle and some GUI updates.
- Fixed the problem with updateUniformFields was only being called for styles
that required lights. 
- Fixes to ShadedVolumeStyle.
- Fix to compile on new gcc version.
- Updates for visual studio 2010.
- Various small bug fixes.

New nodes:
 - ProjectionVolumeStyle, which will deprecate MIPVolumeStyle.
 - BlendedVolumeStyle


Changes for version 1.1.0:

- Added support for preintegrated rendering.
- Remade the MedX3DDemo application. It is much better now.
- Added support for cubic filtering and stochastic jittering.
- Updates to CMake build system.
- Added support for clipped volumes.
- Updates to load the dll as a plugin in H3DViewer.
- Flipped texture coordinates in t because it was incorrect.
- Marching cubes updates.
- Implemented empty space skipping.
- A number of bug fixes.
- Improved OSX support.
- ShadedVolumeStyle is now composable, which is not according to X3D spec.
- Additional volume data files in nrrd format.
- New example files, old ones removed.

New nodes:
 - FrameBufferTexture

Changes for version 1.0.1:

- Added support for jpeg images in Dicom-reader.
- Fixes to MedX3DDemo.
- Updates to build system, some created to reflect changes in H3DAPI 2.0.
