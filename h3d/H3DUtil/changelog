- CMake fixes to support fastbuild.

New classes:
- DualQuaternion
- ThreadPool

New functions:
- epsilonCompare
- H3DClamp
- H3DSqr
- inverseSafe function in matrix classes.
- loadDDSImage
- loadOpenEXRImage
- nearEqual in all linear algebra types.
- saveOpenEXRImage

Compability issues:
- Removal of using std in some headers means adding std:: in headers that
  previously relied on HAPI includes using std.
- Several CMake cache variables have been replaced with new ones.
- Deprecated H3D_USE_DEPENDENCIES_ONLY used in CMake configuration. Replace
  by checking existing targets.
- Many CMake cache variables are now deprecated. Warnings should give
  instructions on what to do about them.
- Previously deprecated constructor for SimpleThread is now removed.

Changes for version 1.3.0:
- Generated header is moved to CMake build directory and can only be found
 in H3DUtil/include after INSTALL project has been built.
- Added profiling capabilities through H3DTimer.
- Renamed FindTeem.cmake to FindH3DTeem.cmake in order to use CMakes new
 FindTeem module if it exists.
- Speed optimizations that could affect some compilers.
- Fixes to properly remove threads in all cases.
- Added a InstallH3DUtilAndExternals.cmake package file which can be used by
 applications to package up needed files by the current H3DUtil build.
- Properly pack ACKNOWLEDGMENTS file.
- Memory leak fixes.
- Added CMake option to include visual leak detector in H3DUtil.
- Updates to CMake build system to build properly when TortoiseSVN is installed
 but the current H3D build is not a TortoiseSVN checkout.
- Added enable/disable functions in Console which allow thread-safe disabling
 of console output.

New classes:
- H3DTimer

New functions:
- saveFreeImagePNG
- Image::setByteAlignment

Changes for version 1.2.0:

- CMake updates to configure build for MinGW toolchain.
- New constructors to Matrix4f(d) to construct matrix from position,
 rotation and scale parameters.
- Fixes to make a proper debian package.
- New constructors for 4 component constructs to use their 3 component version
 plus a single value for the 4th component.
- Fixed bugs with Dicom image loading.
- Fixed a bug in assignment operator of AutoRefVector that would cause a crash
if NULL was added to the vector .
- Fixed a bug that could result in thread locking when a PeriodicThread was 
destructed.
- Updates to compile with gcc 4.5.
- Fixed bug that could cause a problem when deallocating PixelImage instances
created by the loadNrrdFile.
- Fixed a bug that could result in callbacks not being removed from 
removeAsynchronousCallback and clearAllCallbacks.
- Added nrPixelComponents and convertToNormalizedData function to Image class.

Changes for version 1.1.1:

- Updates to compile with gcc 3.1.1 on Ubuntu 9.10 and Visual Studio 2010.
- CMake build updates. Variables that points to include directories and
libraries are now grouped together for each external library.
- Memory allocation and deletion fixes.
- Added support to read paletted image types with FreeImage.

Changes for version 1.1:

- Default rotation axis for Rotation is now 1 0 0 as it should be.
- Added insert and erase methods to AutoRefVector.
- Cmake build system updates, such as explicity listing all files belonging to
the H3DUtil project.
- Fixed bugs reported on www.h3d.org.
- Various important fixes to image classes.
- Additional LoadImageFunctions in order to load DICOM and nrrd images.
- Added Priority enumerator for defining thread priority. The values of the
enumerator used instead of system dependent thread priority definitions.
- Added mechanisms for thread safe Console output.
- Fixes to compile on 64 bit Windows.
- Fixes to compile on recent versions of gcc.
- Documentation updates.

New source files:
 - ReadWriteH3DTypes.h - Contains functions that can be used to write and read
 H3DTypes as binary data to and from a stream.
 - DicomImage.h, DicomImage.cpp. Contains an image loaded from dicom files.


Changes for version 1.0:

- Corrections to CMake build system and additions for compiling against static
 libraries.
- Doxygen updates.
- Fixes in PixelImage and LoadImageFunctions.
- Fixes concerning thread handling.
- Fixed bugs reported on www.h3d.org.

New Classes:
Quaterniond - A double version of Quaternion.
Rotationd - A double version of Rotation.



Changes for version 1.0 beta 1:

- Memory leak fixes.
- The function asynchronousCallback in PeriodicThreadBase returns a handle that
can be used as argument to the new function removeAsynchronousCallback.
- Fixed a lot of minor bugs. See svn changelog at www.h3d.org:8080 for details.
- Added ExtremaFindingAlgorithms which is a collection of algorithms that finds
extrema. Currently only contains an implementation of amoeba.


New Classes and related functions:
Image - class moved here from H3D API.
FreeImageImage - class moved here from H3D API.
LoadImageFunctions - moved functions here. They are used to read image files.
PixelImage - class moved here for H3D API.

Compability issues:
