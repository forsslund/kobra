# kobra
Software for the Kobra Surgery Simulator platform

Note 2024-05-10
If you cannot access the H3D svn repo (I couldn't) you can find the external/ files 
needed to build in Windows here: https://haptikfabriken.com/external.zip 

Update 2023-01-08
Uses the new uhaptikfabriken2.h api, which computes kinematics on PC. 
H3D requires the api to be installed (copied to) to /usr/local/include 
the api is found in the Polhem development repo

Update 2020-12-04 
We have updated H3D

Update 2020-12-02, to compile have uhaptikfabriken.h in /usr/local/include
(available elsewere, I usually link it in during development)
